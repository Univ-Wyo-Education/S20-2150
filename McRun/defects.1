(2hr)
0. Display mem[MAR] HEX / DEC / Ch : +-4, and Disassembled Instruction at that point
	1. Need to display memory as it is used.
	1. Need to display code as it runs - to demo test of code.


(45min)
1. Need to display microcode + Address in Microcode

(30min)
2. Catch Errors
	1. A microcode _data1_ === 0 && _data2_ === 0 should produce an ERROR! - No Output Turned On at Address X




(1hr)
Display the mux input lines and where data is from as it is "turned" on.


(1hr)
Output Box
	1. Output cleanup [ output box ]

(2hr)
Output Reg
	3. Hook up 7-seg display - to "Output"

(2hr)
Input Reg
	4. Add Input modal / w/ Push-Button to Load































































--fixed--
2. The text for the Bus needs to move up by 5 to 10 px
2. Input/Ouptut only displaying 2 digits
3. Invalid data in output-turn on from Microcode
1. On 2nd new load of microcode - area hash not updated. 
	+- after dialog -
	+- Probably same for memory load
	Needs test.
		set mc_hash, mm_hash after fetch of new data, before conv. of text -> storage.
1. Read of Memory -> MDR caus 0Nan - in display of MDR, address in Microcode is "e9" - so beginning of execute after jmp.
	4 ticks into run of machine.
	> ClockRunner() * 4 times. e9 address is loaded at beginning of execute.
	MDR.x._data_ === undefined
	MAR.x._data_ is out of range, loaded with 0xd014 == 53268
+++1. Microcode at b0 is stuck - no address advance.
	MAR 1, MDR 6000
2. Getting "Output" instruction putting data in Input
