1. Issue: ran for a bit then address 5 got overwritten?
	MEMORY.x._data_[5].toString(16)
	Should be 0xd014, became 0x0014 - odd. 


2. hand_out flag is not correct - not working - we get d014 on buss/MAR instead of 0014 from Load instruction at PC == 01 in program.


(2hr)
0. Display mem[MAR] HEX / DEC / Ch : +-4, and Disassembled Instruction at that point
	1. Need to display memory as it is used.
	1. Need to display code as it runs - to demo test of code.
	Show Memory - Modal for Address Range, then display values hex/dec/char for that set of addresses.


(45min)
1. Need to display microcode + Address in Microcode




(1hr)
Display the mux input lines and where data is from as it is "turned" on.


(1hr)
Output Box
	1. Output cleanup [ output box ]

(2hr)
Output Reg
	3. Hook up 7-seg display - to "Output"

(2hr)
Input Reg
	4. Add Input modal / w/ Push-Button to Load





Setup - Config Stuff 
	- Turn on "Dispaly" of Mux Input Lines as set.
		Lt Green if piced to be input
		Lt Mag if not piced but what is input
		Both Hex/Bin display




Buttons:

	(ip)
	Step Tick -- Stop after 1 microcode instruction until the next "step".
		1. Put in a "Fetch-Stop" input -> microcode. (Fetch Cycle) (In "Inc" in Microcode_PC in ./js/microcode_pc_reg.js)
		"ClockRunner()" - rename and make it Step1Tick()

	(ip)
	Step Instruction - Step just 1 instruction.  Stop after.
		1. Put in a "Fetch-Stop" in PC? 	In Microcode? (Fetch Cycle) (In "Inc" in PC? ./js/pc_reg.js)
		Step1Instruction()




	+++ (ip)
	Run - Jump to 0, start running.																				Easy
		- Clear flats that prevent run, do Reset op - let it go!

	Logic Probe - show the logic probe - 	Modal for config of lines - then display??								Probably Hard






















































Test of Halt instruction and light:
	MEMORY.x._data_[1] = 0x7000
	Then run pgroam


--fixed--
2. The text for the Bus needs to move up by 5 to 10 px
2. Input/Ouptut only displaying 2 digits
3. Invalid data in output-turn on from Microcode
1. On 2nd new load of microcode - area hash not updated. 
	+- after dialog -
	+- Probably same for memory load
	Needs test.
		set mc_hash, mm_hash after fetch of new data, before conv. of text -> storage.
1. Read of Memory -> MDR caus 0Nan - in display of MDR, address in Microcode is "e9" - so beginning of execute after jmp.
	4 ticks into run of machine.
	> ClockRunner() * 4 times. e9 address is loaded at beginning of execute.
	MDR.x._data_ === undefined
	MAR.x._data_ is out of range, loaded with 0xd014 == 53268
+++1. Microcode at b0 is stuck - no address advance.
	MAR 1, MDR 6000
2. Getting "Output" instruction putting data in Input
Add an "output" line from Microcode that shows "IsHalted" -> A """LED""" output.
	Make a Red/Green LED output.
	Make a Red/Green LED - Error.  Use for the All zero microcode state.
(30min)
2. Catch Errors
	1. A microcode _data1_ === 0 && _data2_ === 0 should produce an ERROR! - No Output Turned On at Address X
	Make a Red/Green LED - Error.  Use for the All zero microcode state.
	Place LEDs / Switch On left of machine near PC
	(See ./led-0.html -has "PATH" for the display in it)
Would be nice to have a Fetch/Execute flag that is shown. (Similar to Halt)  LED
