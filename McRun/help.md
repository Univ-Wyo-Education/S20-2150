# MARIE Microcode Emulator

## Emulator Version

Version 1.4.7

This document applies to version 1.4.7.  You can see the version on the JavaScript console when the page is loaded or by clicking on the
"Help" button in the interface.

## Overview

The emulator is designed to work with the McAsm microcode assembler and the Asm command line assembler.  In each case a `-U` (--upload) flag will
upload the assembled files (the `.hex`) files to a common server where the emulator can fetch them from and run them.

You will need both kinds of `.hex` files.
