# Short Zoom Usage Intro

Welcome!

Real quick, a couple of minutes on zoom and how to use it.

We are going to be using zoom for office hours and other class things.  (Probably not for lectures
and that requires lots of bandwidth).

1. Download and install the zoom.app on your system. [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download)
There is a browser based vision but it uses a lot more computer and bandwidth resources.
2. For office hours we will use the this link: [https://uwyo.zoom.us/j/5976304542](https://uwyo.zoom.us/j/5976304542)

If you just cut-and-paste the link into your browsers URL it should ask you if you want to start the zoom.app.
Say yes.

My office hours are changed:

Mon 8:00am to 10:00am <br>
Tue 8:00am to 10:00am <br>
Wed 8:00am to noon <br>
Wed 4:00pm to 6:00pm <br>
Thr 8:00am to noon <br>

I am usually online - so if you need an appointment - send email and let's set up a time.

When you start zoom it will ask you if you want to join with computer audio / computer video.  Unless you
have an external audio / video source - you should click yes.

There are buttons at the bottom of the video screen.
If you move your mouse out of the video screen - the button bar will disappear. 

With the mouse in the screen - on the left there are 2 buttons to turn on/off your audio and on/off your video.
Depending on how you have zoom configured it may start with these off.   If you see video of the person on 
the other end and they are waiving at you and pointing at the side of their head - they are trying to tell
you that you have the audio muted or it is not working.

Remember to say something when you start up or join a session.  "Hello" is good.  Also you will probably need
to introduce yourself.  You are joining an shared session - so there may be other people that are already
there.  I will let you know if you  need to wait.  Office hours via zoom are open - and you can listen
in.

Remember that your video may be live.  This means that anything in the background is also live when you
start a session.  I will be in my un-finished basement.  It's ugly - bit it works.    To prevent embarrassment
I always check my background before starting a zoom session.  Remember that the video is "live".

My keyboard and main screen are to the left of my camera - so I may step out of view.

In the center at the bottom there is a green "share screen" button.   To share your screen click this and
it will give you the choice to share a window or your entire screen.  Pick appropriately and then the blue
button on the bottom right.

At the end you need to get out of the video session.  The leave button is the red one on the bottom
right.

If you loose a connection just re-join with the URL.

Zoom has a free personal meeting tear - so if you need to use zoom for yourself you should sign up.

Happy Zooming!
