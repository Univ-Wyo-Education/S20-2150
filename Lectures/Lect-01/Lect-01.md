# Lecture 01 - Machine Architecture

## Survey on languages that you know

For homework that is not in MARIA - our emulated machine you
have your choice of { C, C++, Python, Go, Haskell, F#, Swift } as your
language of implementation.  If you do other than C/C++/Python then 
I will be grading your homework instead of the graduate assistant - so
it may take longer to get graded.



## More strict late policy

In previous classes with a much smaller number of people I have
been lax in my late policy.  16 Students in 1015 was stretching
my ability to deal with lots of late work.  This class with 40 
students is way to large to allow for a very liberal late policy.
So... 

Homework will be due on the due date with a 10% per day late
penalty.
