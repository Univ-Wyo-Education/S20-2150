# Lecture 01 - Machine Architecture

## Survey on languages that you know

For homework that is not in MARIA - our emulated machine you
have your choice of { C, C++, Python, Go, Haskell, F#, Swift, Kotlin } as your
language of implementation.  If you do other than C/C++/Python/Go then 
I will be grading your homework instead of the graduate assistant - so
it may take longer to get graded.  If you pick other than C, C++, Python
or Go you are responsible for knowing the language (Go is taught in 4010/5010
special topics - blockchain.  You should have had C++.  I don't care for
Java or JavaScript(node.js) so don't do your homework in those languages).
Some of the class will be in MARIA an assembly language.  We will be learning
that in this class.



## More strict late policy

In previous classes with a much smaller number of people I have
been lax in my late policy.  16 Students in 1015 was stretching
my ability to deal with lots of late work.  This class with 40 
students is way to large to allow for a very liberal late policy.
So... 

Homework will be due on the due date with a 10% per day late
penalty.

|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Homework 1 - Setup / Access MARIE - Price Computer        | 200 Pts |
| Homework 2 - Representation of Numbers / ASCII / Unicode  | 200 Pts |
| Homework 3 - Boolean Algebra - Gates / Error Correction   | 200 Pts |
| Homework 4 - MARIE 1st program                            | 200 Pts |
| Homework 5 - MARIE assembly language programs             | 200 Pts |
| Homework 6 - Implement MARIE Emulator                     | 200 Pts |
| Homework 7 - Multiply/Divide Subroutine in MARIE          | 200 Pts |        
| Homework 8 - Microcode Part 1                             | 200 Pts |
| Homework 9 - Microcode Part 2                             | 200 Pts |    
| Homework 10 - Compiled Code / Paper (1-2 page)            | 200 Pts |

Note on the 1-2 page paper - this is not a formal paper.  Just put it
in a text file.   A list with your analysis of the compiled code
and how it is working - along with a screen capture of the
logic analyzer will be fine.
