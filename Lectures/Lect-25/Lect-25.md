## Software and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

There are lots of "IDE"s - like Eclipse for Java and PyCharm for Python.

Please read the linked web page on IDEs. 

If all we did was develop desktop GUI applications IDEs would sort of make sense.
Reality is that most software today is:

1. Distributed over the web (web front end / server back end connecting to a database)
2. Running on servers (in remote data centers like AWS/EC2)
3. Running on embedded devices (iOS/Apple, Android, IoT, Controllers, Blockchain)

## What is the alternative to the "finder"

The command line.

What is good about the command line?  Isn't it ancient - yes it is.

1. It is repeatable.  - Example WIX.
2. It is a "language" - what this means - DFA/NDFA v.s. Push Down Automata.
3. It is testable - that means it is reliable.
4. It works remotely.
5. It has software re usability.
6. It is documentable.
7. It is everywhere.
