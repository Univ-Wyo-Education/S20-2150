# Lecture 03 - What is knowing machine architecture good for?



## Example 1 - NTRU Encryption

Quantum Computers and the "shore" algorithm will break RSA and ECDSA encryption.
This is the underlying encryption behind TLS, the transport layer security that
enables all of HTTPS.

Quick explanation of how ECDSA works.

Why non-planer encryption is quantum proof.

Google current at 53 bits.  Needs to get to 64 to 98 bits to break ECDSA.

NTRU Encryption entered into the NIS competition 4 years ago.  NTRU Is a replacement
for all of ECDSA that is quantum proof.  It is also faster than ECDSA and AES.
One of the finalists for the new encryption standard.

Port to multiple architectures.
