# Lecture 14 - Mon Mar  2 

## Test Stats

1. 1/2 of you got it done in 1/2 the time - so not too long.
2. Everybody managed to answer in the space given - so enough paper.
3. Averag 264.3 out of 300 ( so high B ).
4. Low 141, high 300 out of 300.
5. It is graded - but I can't return it - I still have a couple of people that have yet to take it.  So hopefully by Wednesday. 
6. Homework 2 is nearly done getting graded  - and will soon be return.
7. Homework 3 .  Hm.. 
8. Homework 4 - Build a MARIA emulator.

## History of of the von Neumann architecture

From 1945 - first published.  From his 1945 description:

<table><tbody><tr><th>MAR</a></th><td>Memory Address Register</a></td><td>Holds the memory location of data that needs to be accessed</td></tr><tr><th>MDR</a></th><td>Memory Data Register</a></td><td>Holds data&nbsp;that is being transferred to or from&nbsp;memory</td></tr><tr><th>AC</a></th><td>Accumulator</a></td><td>Where intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored</td></tr><tr><th>PC</a></th><td>Program Counter</a></td><td>Contains the address of the next instruction to be executed</td></tr><tr><th>CIR</a></th><td>Current Instruction Register</a></td><td>Contains the current instruction during processing</td></tr></tbody></table>

We are calling the CIR the IR.

The Fetch-Execute cycle is the process where we get an instruction from memory into the IR, decode it in the control system, move and process data (the ALU or just movement)
and then apply this to Input and Output.

Used in Testing (For more complicated tests).   PostgreSQL (141281 tests), SQLite, Linux Network Stack, Ethereum.

Used For Building interpreters.
